Virtual AI Clinician – Generative AI for Accurate Medical Diagnosis

Virtual AI Clinician is a scalable, AI-powered medical consultation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate real doctor-patient interactions.
It can diagnose 900+ common conditions, provide accurate triage recommendations (98% accuracy), and deliver an empathetic, human-like consultation experience via an AI doctor avatar.This project is designed to assist patients with non-emergency symptoms, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and ensure affordable, accessible, and consistent primary care.

Features

* AI-Powered Consultation – Natural conversations with follow-up questions.
* Clinical Reasoning – Combines LLMs with medical guidelines & safety layers.
* Human-like Avatar Interface – Builds trust & engagement with patients.
* Consultation History & Reports – Downloadable PDF summaries.
* Emergency Detection – Identifies red-flag symptoms and alerts users.
* Symptom Tracker – Log daily health updates & monitor trends.

System Architecture

1. Initial Patient Input – Collect symptoms via text/voice.
2. Intent Detection – LLM analyzes symptom meaning.
3. Information Gathering – AI asks clinical follow-ups.
4. Clinical Reasoning – Apply LLMs + medical rules for safe output.
5. Recommendation Output – Diagnosis suggestion, self-care tips, or doctor referral.
