Virtual AI Clinician – Generative AI for Accurate Medical Diagnosis
Project Overview
Virtual AI Clinician is a scalable, AI-powered medical consultation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate real doctor-patient interactions.
It can diagnose 900+ common conditions, provide accurate triage recommendations (98% accuracy), and deliver an empathetic, human-like consultation experience via an AI doctor avatar.This project is designed to assist patients with non-emergency symptoms, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and ensure affordable, accessible, and consistent primary care.

Features
AI-powered consultation with natural conversation flow.
Clinical reasoning combining LLMs with medical guidelines.
Human-like avatar interface for trust and engagement.
Multilingual support for global accessibility.
Consultation history with downloadable PDF reports.
Emergency detection for red-flag symptoms.
Symptom tracker to log daily health updates.

System Architecture
Initial Patient Input – Collect symptoms via text/voice.
Intent Detection – LLM analyzes symptom meaning.
Information Gathering – AI asks clinical follow-up questions.
Clinical Reasoning – Apply LLMs + medical rules for safe output.
Recommendation Output – Diagnosis suggestion, self-care tips, or doctor referral.
